# ...similar about the APIs?

I found that all of these APIs provided ways to change and view the data at very
granular levels and ways to easily find exact pieces of data that one may look for. Many of them also provide time based data retrieval. I saw that most APIs return their response in JSON format, but sometimes you can also specify what type of response you want. Also most of these APIs are looking for something called an API key.


# ...elements that you find helpful and unhelpful?
I found that it was helpful to see examples of response types and also thorough documentation of how this works. It's pretty unhelpful when the documentation only shows possible get requests without showing the differences in the responses because then the user/developer has to go through and figure out how the data will be formatted and parsed all on their own. This can be especially annoying if there are a maximum number of calls that you are allowed to make for an API.

# ... other 2 APIs
I looked at both Robinhood and TDAmeritrades APIs to see how I could possibly make a tool to help me organize my portfolios. I saw that both of these APIs provide time based data for stocks and options but one thing that Robinhood is lacking is publicly available documentation. TD on the other hand provides this and shows how you can also execute trades using the API meanwhile for RH I had to look through multiple different websites to get an idea of how the API *might* work.


# characteristics of a good API

I think there are a few things that make a good API but here are the top three:
1. **Simplicity** is the most important thing for me when it comes to understanding and using these APIs, the design should be intuitive and easy to navigate both requests and response data.

2. **Consistency** is also important because if I am looking for similar types of data or making the same requests I want the same data/format back every time. (This was an issue I faced after yahoo decided to update their stock API)

3. **Completeness** is also something I deem important because I don't want to feel hindered or let down by the way I have to access or lack access to data.
